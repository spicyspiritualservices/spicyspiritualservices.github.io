      <h2>Hi, I’m Ruthie.</h2>

      <p>I haven’t been doing this my whole life, at least not in the way I am now. For a long time, I moved through the world the way I thought I was supposed to. I followed the expectations, the roles, the “be fine, be strong, keep going” version of life that so many of us inherit.</p>

      <p>Then, about four years ago, something shifted. It wasn’t loud. It was quiet, like a part of me I had ignored finally asking to be heard.</p>

      <p>I started tuning into myself. Into my own happiness. Into the way my body responded to truth. Into the presence of Spirit that had been with me long before I ever acknowledged it.</p>

      <p>Once I began listening, I couldn’t turn away from it. And I didn’t want to.</p>

    <h3>◆ My Ability</h3>
    <p>I call it an ability, not a gift. Not something that makes me special.</p>

    <p>My ability is simple and steady. I can feel what’s underneath. I can hear what’s quiet. I can translate what Spirit is trying to say in a way that feels grounded and human.</p>

    <p>I don’t predict futures. I don’t perform. I don’t use fear. I don’t tell you who to be.</p>

    <p>I sit with you. I listen. I translate. I hold the space with clarity and compassion.</p>

    <h3>◆ What It’s Like to Work With Me</h3>
    <p>When you’re with me, you’re not getting a show. You’re getting someone who is fully present with you—emotionally, intuitively, spiritually.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>hear what your spirit has been whispering</li>
      <li>reconnect with loved ones who have crossed</li>
      <li>understand the patterns that keep looping</li>
      <li>soften the places where you’ve been hard on yourself</li>
      <li>remember who you are beneath the noise</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My sessions move at the pace your nervous system can hold. They’re gentle, direct, and deeply attuned.</p>

    <h3>◆ Why I Do This</h3>
    <p>I know what it feels like to live a life that looks fine on the outside but feels disconnected on the inside. I know what it feels like to ignore your own knowing. To crave clarity but fear what it might reveal. To feel something bigger calling you and not know how to answer.</p>
