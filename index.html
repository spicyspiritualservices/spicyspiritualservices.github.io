            “Ruthie has been such an amazing mentor! We first met on TikTok and I would ask her for readings. She was always spot on and held me to a standard I should’ve been holding myself to. With her help, I have gained confidence in myself and my abilities. As our friendship grew, she helped me figure out the path I needed to be on, and has now helped me become a Reiki practitioner. Her gifts are beautiful and her honesty is rare. I couldn’t have asked for a better mentor and friend in my life. If you’re thinking of booking with her, please do. You won’t regret it.”

            “Ruthie has given me several readings and she has shared so much love and compassion in all of them. She’s been spot on with the information about my loved ones. She’s also done healing and spirit talks with me and she has been upfront and honest in such a loving way. She’s very knowledgeable about everything spiritual, and I would highly highly recommend her. She has a heart of gold. She’s one of the most caring people I have gotten to know and now consider a friend.”

            “I can not recommend Ruthie highly enough! I have had several readings with her… everything from psychic to mediumship to astrology to Reiki. She always shows the utmost respect for spirit and care for her clients. I have gone back to her multiple times because of the amazing quality of her readings, the kindness and acceptance in which she shows to everyone, and the beautiful connection she has with spirit. I have always left her space feeling calmer and more connected to spirit. She is wise beyond her years. If you are looking for someone to have a reading with, I highly encourage you to book with her. I am so grateful for her guidance and support.”
